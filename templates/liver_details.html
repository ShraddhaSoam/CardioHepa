    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The liver is an organ that sits just under the rib cage on the right side of the abdomen. It can weigh up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). The liver is needed to help digest food, rid the body of waste products and make substances, called clotting factors, that keep the blood flowing well, among other tasks.</p>
        <p>Liver disease can be passed through families, called inherited. Anything that damages the liver also can cause liver problems, including viruses, alcohol use and obesity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin.</li>
            <li>Belly pain and swelling.</li>
            <li>Swelling in the legs and ankles.</li>
            <li>Itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Dark urine.</li>
            <li>Pale stool.</li>
            <li>Constant tiredness.</li>
            <li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite.</li>
            <li>Bruising easily.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Liver disease has many causes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Infection
                <ul>
                    <li>Parasites and viruses can infect the liver, causing swelling and irritation, called inflammation. Inflammation keeps the liver from working as it should. The viruses that cause liver damage can be spread through blood or semen, bad food or water, or close contact with a person who is infected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-factors">
        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Factors that can increase the risk of liver disease include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ongoing moderate or heavy alcohol use.</li>
            <li>Obesity.</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Tattoos or body piercings.</li>
            <li>Shared needles to inject drugs.</li>
            <li>Blood transfusion before 1992.</li>
            <li>Contact with other people's blood and body fluids.</li>
            <li>Sex without protection.</li>
            <li>Contact with chemicals or toxins.</li>
            <li>Family history of liver disease.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>To prevent liver disease:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.</li>
            <li>Avoid risky behavior. Use a condom during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, pick a shop that's clean and safe. Seek help if you shoot illicit drugs. Don't share needles to shoot drugs.</li>
            <li>Get vaccinated. If you're at increased risk of getting hepatitis, talk with your healthcare professional about getting the hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines. This also is true if you've been infected with any form of the hepatitis virus.</li>
            <li>Be careful when taking medicines. Take prescription and other medicines only when needed. Take only as much as directed. Don't mix medicines and alcohol. Talk with your healthcare provider before mixing herbal supplements or prescription or other medicines.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="when-to-see-doctor">
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have any lasting symptoms that worry you. Seek medical help right away if you have belly pain that is so bad that you can't stay still.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-to-fill-form">
        <h2>How to Fill the Form</h2>
        <p>To fill the form related to liver disease, provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Age of the patient in years</li>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Gender of the patient (0 = male, 1 = female)</li>
            <li><strong>Total Bilirubin:</strong> Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down. A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. It’s used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Bilirubin:</strong> Bilirubin attached by the liver to glucuronic acid, a glucose-derived acid, is called direct or conjugated, bilirubin. Bilirubin not attached to glucuronic acid is called indirect.</li>
            <li><strong>Alkaline Phosphatase:</strong> Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme in a person’s blood that helps break down proteins. Using an ALP test, it is possible to measure how much of this enzyme is circulating in a person’s blood.</li>
            <li><strong>Alamine Aminotransferase:</strong> Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney. ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Aspartate Aminotransferase:</strong> AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but also in muscles. When your liver is damaged, it releases AST into your bloodstream. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test can help your health care provider diagnose liver damage or disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Proteins:</strong> Albumin and globulin are two types of protein in your body. The total protein test measures the total amount of albumin and globulin in your body.</li>
            <li><strong>Albumin and Globulin Ratio:</strong> This refers to the ratio between albumin and globulin in the blood, which can provide insights into liver function.</li>
        </ul>
